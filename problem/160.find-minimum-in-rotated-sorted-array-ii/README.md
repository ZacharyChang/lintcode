# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II
-----
Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).

Find the minimum element.

### Example
Given ```[4,4,5,6,7,0,1,2]``` return ```0```.

## Notice
The array may contain duplicates.
